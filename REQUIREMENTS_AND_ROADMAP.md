# Werewolf Contest Management - Requirements & Roadmap

## Scope Definition (Q&A Session)

### OUT OF SCOPE ‚ùå
- **Weight class validation**: Competitors can register in any weight class without validation
- **Attempt progression rules**: No enforcement of powerlifting federation rules about weight increases
- **Age category validation**: No birth date validation against categories  
- **Equipment categories**: No raw vs equipped tracking
- **Judge decisions**: No individual judge scoring or majority decisions
- **Timers and timing**: No attempt timers or clock displays
- **Multiple flights/platforms**: Single platform/flight only
- **Announcer functionality**: No integrated announcer features
- **Federation integration**: No uploads to IPF, USPA, etc. databases
- **Records tracking**: No meet records, personal records, or qualification totals
- **User roles & access**: No different permission levels
- **Audit trails**: No tracking of who made what changes
- **Invalid attempts**: No technical foul tracking (just did/didn't do)
- **Hardware integration**: No timing lights or external displays

### IN SCOPE ‚úÖ
- **Simple attempt tracking**: Good/bad results only
- **Offline operation**: Desktop app, no internet required
- **Dual window system**: Organizer window + display window
- **Flexible editing**: Full CRUD on all records (not banking-level restrictions)
- **Simple backup/recovery**: Needs to be reliable but simple
- **Basic results export**: Format TBD, simple approach

### UNKNOWN/TBD ü§î
- **Results export formats**: Excel? PDF? What formats needed?
- **Tie-breaking rules**: How to resolve placement ties?

## ULTRATHINK: Strategic Analysis & Next Steps

### Core Insight: SIMPLE IS THE FEATURE
This app is intentionally scoped as a **simple, reliable tool** for basic contest management. The user explicitly rejected complex powerlifting federation features - this is about **core workflow efficiency**, not comprehensive meet management.

### Current State Assessment
‚úÖ **Backend Foundation**: Solid domain models, CRUD operations, state management  
‚úÖ **Code Quality**: 8/10 from Grug, production-ready backend  
‚úÖ **Test Coverage**: Core logic tested, state transitions validated  
üîÑ **Frontend Integration**: Basic but needs polish for real-world use  
‚ùå **Backup/Recovery**: No strategy in place  
‚ùå **Results/Export**: No output functionality  
‚ùå **Real-world UX**: Needs validation with actual competition workflow

## ROADMAP: Next Development Phases

### **Phase 1: Core Workflow Completion** (Immediate Priority)
**Goal**: Make the basic contest flow actually work end-to-end for a real competition

#### 1.1 Frontend Polish & Real-world UX
- **Contest creation wizard**: Step-by-step setup flow
- **Competitor registration bulk import**: CSV upload for large competitions  
- **Attempt entry interface**: Quick, keyboard-friendly attempt logging
- **Current lifter display**: Polish the display window for audience/officials
- **Navigation flow**: Smooth transitions between contest phases

#### 1.2 Results Display & Basic Export  
- **Leaderboard calculation**: Real-time rankings by total, Wilks, etc.
- **Results export**: Start with simple Excel/CSV export
- **Competition summary**: Final results report
- **Basic tie-breaking**: Simple approach (earliest successful attempt wins?)

#### 1.3 Data Integrity & Recovery
- **SQLite backup strategy**: Automatic timestamped backups before major operations
- **Recovery UI**: Simple restore from backup functionality  
- **Data validation**: Prevent impossible states (negative weights, etc.)
- **Error handling**: Graceful recovery from corrupt data

### **Phase 2: Production Readiness** (Next Priority)
**Goal**: Make it reliable enough for real competitions with real consequences

#### 2.1 Performance & Reliability
- **Database optimization**: Indexes, query performance for large competitions
- **Memory management**: Handle long-running competitions without leaks
- **Stress testing**: Performance under realistic load (100+ competitors)
- **Error monitoring**: Better logging and error reporting

#### 2.2 User Experience Validation  
- **Real competition testing**: Test with actual powerlifting meet
- **Workflow optimization**: Identify and fix pain points in real use
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Power-user efficiency features
- **Visual polish**: Professional appearance for official competitions

#### 2.3 Documentation & Deployment
- **User manual**: Step-by-step guide for meet directors
- **Installation package**: Easy deployment for non-technical users
- **Troubleshooting guide**: Common issues and solutions

### **Phase 3: Enhancement & Extensibility** (Future)
**Goal**: Add value without complexity creep

#### 3.1 Advanced Features (If Needed)
- **Multiple export formats**: PDF certificates, federation-specific formats
- **Historical data**: Past competition results database  
- **Advanced tie-breaking**: Configurable tie-breaking rules
- **Spectator features**: Read-only web interface for results

#### 3.2 Integration Possibilities
- **Simple API**: For external results display systems
- **Backup to cloud**: Optional cloud backup for peace of mind

## IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS (This Week)

### Priority 1: **Fix Build System**
- Resolve the nightly Rust configuration preventing clean `cargo test`
- Ensure development environment is stable

### Priority 2: **Frontend-Backend Integration Testing**
- Create integration tests that exercise full command ‚Üí database ‚Üí frontend flow
- Verify that all Tauri commands work correctly with the frontend

### Priority 3: **Basic Results Functionality**  
- Implement leaderboard calculation in backend
- Create results display component in frontend
- Add simple export (CSV/Excel) functionality

### Priority 4: **Simple Backup Strategy**
- SQLite database backup before contest start
- Manual backup/restore functionality in UI
- Automatic backup every N operations

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

### **Minimum Viable Competition** (Phase 1 Complete)
- [ ] Can run a complete 50-competitor powerlifting meet start to finish
- [ ] Results calculated correctly with basic tie-breaking  
- [ ] Backup/restore works reliably
- [ ] Export results to Excel/PDF for record-keeping
- [ ] No data loss or corruption under normal use

### **Production Ready** (Phase 2 Complete)  
- [ ] Used successfully in 3+ real competitions
- [ ] Zero critical bugs in production use
- [ ] Performance acceptable for largest expected competitions (200+ competitors)
- [ ] User documentation sufficient for independent use

**Bottom Line**: Focus on making a **rock-solid, simple tool** that does the core job perfectly rather than a complex system that does everything poorly.
